This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of two different policy representations in the field of imitation learning using the OpenAI Gym environments: Acrobot, Lunar Lander, Half Cheetah and Ant. The first representation is based on a standard deep neural network (NN). The second approach uses an Integral Neural Network (INN). INN is characterized by continuous functions and integration operations, which allow to reduce the size of the network while maintaining reliable policy accuracy in selecting agent actions. For the first time, we tested the INN representation and checked its online resizing transformation.
