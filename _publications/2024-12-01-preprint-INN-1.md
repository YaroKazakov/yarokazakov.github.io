The pursuit of artificial intelligence (AI) that mirrors the capabilities of the human brain has driven advances in computer science, engineering, and neuroscience. Traditional AI approaches struggle with the complexities of real-world scenarios that require larger and larger sizes of neural networks and massive datasets and computational power. This is where more cognitive computing, inspired by the biological architecture of the brain, emerges as a promising solution.
