The paper examines the issue of catastrophic forgetting and online resizing in the context of imitation learning. The research compares agents based on Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (NN), Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KAN) and Integral Neural Networks (INN). The study confirms that KAN agents are less prone to catastrophic forgetting compared to NN and INN-based agents. This behavior makes them promising for continuous learning in complex environments with long episodes. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of catastrophic forgetting and provide valuable insights into the potential of KANs for improving the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms.
