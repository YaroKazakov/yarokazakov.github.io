My final year thesis from 2021 explored AI tools for analyzing turbulent flow[^1]. Before 2019-2020, academia primarily relied on numerical, statistical, and deterministic methods to model turbulent flows. Numerical solutions often demand significant computational resources, especially for complex geometries. Statistical methods, such as Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, are limited to relatively simple geometries. Deterministic approaches tend to oversimplify flows, neglecting factors like viscosity and compressibility. We proposed a novel approach using autoencoding feed-forward neural networks to analyze coherent structures in turbulent flows.

For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxumlvAdDxI"> this video </a> discusses the idea of exploring AI for turbulence structures.
