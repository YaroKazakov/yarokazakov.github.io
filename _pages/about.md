Hey everyone, I'm Yaro! I live in Austin, TX, and I'm the ex-founder of Veritas, an AI prospecting platform for financial advisors designed to supercharge growth. I transitioned from engineering to reinforcement learning and quant finance, driven by a strong passion for understanding intelligence, building algorithms, and using stochastic modeling in unknown settings. I hold an MEng in Aerospace and Aeronautics from Imperial College London and an MSc in Financial Mathematics from the University of Chicago. I worked at Dimensional Fund Advisors on the strategy research desk until May 2024, when I decided to start my own venture at Veritas.

Currently, my main focus is on Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, I'm curious about Imitation Learning (Behavioral Cloning and Inverse Learning), Diffusion Models, Robotics, Model-free Learning, Long-term Autonomy, Knowledge Representation, Semantic Mapping, Optimal Control, Perception, Integrated Neural Networks for RL, Neuromorphic RL. Outside of research, I enjoy quantitative and systematic investing with options, and I consider  building a tracker to share my thoughts on this topic.
