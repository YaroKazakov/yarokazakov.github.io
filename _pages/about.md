Hey everyone, I'm Yaro! I live in Austin, TX, and I'm the ex-founder of Veritas, an AI prospecting platform for financial advisors designed to supercharge growth. I transitioned from engineering to quant finance and reinforcement learning, driven by a strong passion for understanding intelligence, building algorithms, and using stochastic modeling in unknown settings. I hold an MEng in Aerospace and Aeronautics from Imperial College London and an MSc in Financial Mathematics from the University of Chicago. I worked at Dimensional Fund Advisors on the strategy research desk until May 2024, when I decided to start my own venture at Veritas.
